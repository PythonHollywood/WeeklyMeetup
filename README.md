# Python in Hollywood

Welcome to *Python in Hollywood*, part of
[Learn to Code LA](http://www.meetup.com/LearnToCodeLA/).

We meet every Sunday in Hollywood with a planned Python topic or
micro-project. Multi-session pair programming projects are also
encouraged/facilitated. 

If you're new, just show up and say hello. It's what we all did not
long ago. We're very friendly and helpful - if you have a question
(any question), just ask!

# Installing Python

You will need to have Python installed on your computer. If you're on
Linux or Mac, chances are that you have it preinstalled on your system.
Nevertheless, it might be a good idea to upgrade to the latest version.

You can write Python in any text editor, but it might be easier to use
an integrated development environment (IDE) that gives you extended
debugging functionality. We recommend
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

## Python 2 or 3?

Python is available in two versions: 2.7 and 3.x. Python 2.7 is not being
developed any more, but some third-party packages support only this version
of Python. Version 3.x (currently 3.5) is the future of the language.
Most of the examples in this repository are written for Python 2.7
but will generally run on Python 3.x with some occasional tweaks.

# Working with Git and GitHub

Since 2015-10-18 we use [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting code
and instructions relating to our meetup. [Git](http://git-scm.com) is
a version control system that is well suited for sharing code between
co-workers. GitHub is the most popular site for hosting git repositories.

Git can be a bit intimidating at first, but don't worry. If you feel
uncertain about using Git you can download the repository as a zip
archive from GitHub. We do however recommend that you become accustomed
to working with Git if you are serious about learning programming.

To get started with Git and GitHub we recommend this
[interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io). Once you've completed it
you should be ready to install Git on your machine. We recommend that
you
[install the GitHub desktop app](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
which includes core Git.

# Quick Start

If you are eager to get started, this is the section for you. Follow these
steps to get started ASAP.

1. Download and install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   (Currently 2.7.10)

2. Go through this [informal introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html).

3. Download and install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

4. Go through the [PyCharm Quick Start Guide](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/Exploring+the+IDE.+Quick+Start+Guide).

5. [Download this repository](https://github.com/PythonHollywood/WeeklyMeetup/archive/master.zip)
   and start working with the examples.

# Next Step

Here are some ideas for where to go from here.

* Come to our meetup. Look for "Python in Hollywood" on the
  [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/LearnToCodeLA/) for info
  about location and time.
  
* Take a look at our [previous topics](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-QT2jKIFa_NblZEZDFBQU5zUTg&usp=sharing).

* Contribute something cool that you've made!
